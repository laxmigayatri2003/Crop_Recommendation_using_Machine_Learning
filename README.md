# Crop_Recommendation_using_Machine_Learning
It is a crop recommendation dataset giving us information about various types of crops and the features that decide which crop is suitable for growing. I've used  Random Forest  algorithm because it is a supervised ensemble machine learning algorithm used in both classification as well as regression problems.
It takes less training time and produce high accuracy even for large dataset it runs efficiently.
